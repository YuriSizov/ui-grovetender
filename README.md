## UI Grovetender

**UI Grovetender** is an intuitive app for quickly creating game UIs.

Use its visual tools to mock up and animate widgets and layouts, then export to your game engine of choice. _UI Grovetender_ produces necessary scenes, resources, and scripts for you, with easy hooks to integrate generated widgets into your project as if they are native components.

**Warning:** The project is still very early in development. See the [list of open issues](https://github.com/YuriSizov/ui-grovetender/issues) for an approximate roadmap and overall progress.


## How to contribute

The project is in its early days, so everything is in a bit of flummox. Still, if you want to participate at this stage, please take a look at open issues and see if you can offer an opinion or help on something.

You can also try the project and offer feedback based on that. However, at this point features are unpolished or outright missing, and bugs are to be expected. So take that into consideration.

The project is made with [Godot 4.3](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/#4.3), with no external dependencies. It currently targets Linux, macOS, and Windows.
